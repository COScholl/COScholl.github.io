### Iteration

So, at the moment, my website is purposefully derivitive. I have utilized resources
from the Homebrewery and GM Binder to style every element of the site. I have used
the Hyde layout from the list of free-to-use Jekyll layouts. If you look at the 
source code in my GitHub, you will see everything there is derivitive.

That's okay.

Other than a fear of a cease and desist letter from Wizards of the Coast for using
so much fifth edition style, I am feeling pretty good about today as the official
start for designing my website.

I can't rely on another's IP, but I feel great about starting my own brand as a 
professional based on the styles of another. It makes me feel good to have gotten 
to this point, but I can't let someone else's style define who I am or what I want 
to be.

So, the next step for this site is to get my own palette, and then to look at fonts.
I am digging the D&D style, and the reason why I styled the way I styled is to see
how the above-mentioned sites could turn markdown language into such slickly styled
pages.

Now I have an idea.

So, it's time to change it up. Time to iterate. Time to get that boulder rolling.
