### Preparations nearly done
I have a skills assessment for JavaScript and React that I am going to take today. I feel pretty good about what I have been doing to prepare since the tenth. I have knocked out the following sections for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification:

- Basic JavaScript
- ES6
- Regular Expressions
- Debugging
- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- Object Oriented Programming

This leaves Basic Data Structures, Functional Programming, Intermediate Algorithm Scripting and JavaScript and Data Structures Projects. Side effect of this prep: I will have this certification soon, but it is important that I stop for now and focus on preparing for this skill test.

I think that the OOP section was the most valuable, since it helped make sense of the class-based React component design patterns that I had started working with once upon a time. All that I want to do is to spend a couple of hours going over React docs a bit to make sure that I feel confident about all of the concepts that will help me score higher. I feel like there is a little bit of a time crunch, so I want to make sure that I get this done tonight.
