### Working on Some Things

To-do:

* ~~build out rpg page and collections~~
* refactor head.html and sidebar.html
* followup with pages in root directory refactor
	* decide if they are all going to be markdown or html and stick to it
	* clean up format based on previous bullet
* get fonts figured out, including backup websafe fonts
* unset styling on links for all pages
* brainstorm future styling additions
* **add content**

I have started working on my first document for the RPG section
of the site. I will be looking at giant creatures in fifth
edition *Dungeons & Dragons*, and using that as a springboard
to brush up on some basic statistics, as well as to create guidelines
for giantism in fifth edition, and how to convert creatures.

There are some interesting things from the RPG *Dungeon Crawl Classics*
that I would like to explore, and I think working on the difference between
giant creatures and their non-giant counterparts could be useful in 
modifying creatures in D&D based on some of those cool DCC ideas. It is also
going to be useful in some conversions that I plan to explore within the 
various D&D editions.

Furthermore, I need to get some ReactJS projects going. The past month, my 
weekends have pretty much revovled around getting this site up, and posting
here and there. Now that the basics are in place, I will need to continue working
on my professional development. Studying is important.

I hope to have some new code examples and exploration in the Grimoire section
based on the resources that I will be working with.

That's the update for now.
