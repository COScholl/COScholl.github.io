### COVID-19 Layoff

I was let go from my job yesterday because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. When you work for an insuretech company, and insurance carriers and brokers are scrambling because of the impact of COVID-19 on their policies and because the market is tanking, well, suddenly their appetite for investments in startups dry up. At least, that is what I have heard the reason for layoffs at my company were. I was the most junior person on the Applications team. I had made it to Software Engineer I, and was working up to a transition to Software Engineer II.

By all accounts, I ramped-up quickly. I was working with React mostly, from a web app that used class-based components, using Redux to manage global state, and sitting on top of Meteor, to newer and smaller applications that used functional components, React Router, and talking to an API that connected to lots of other in-house apps and services. I had learned how to do all sorts of things. The issue (I fear) that I will run into while trying to get a new gig is that there are some hiring freezes locally, because SE Michigan is pretty hard hit with the spread of the virus, and that I had set up a lot of systems on my work computer that did not separate work and personal resources well.

I had been using LastPass for password management, and I had not only work-related passwords, but also personal passwords. I had set it up to work with my companies ecosystem, and when I was let go, those resources were deleted.

I had set up a new Github for work, and I think that I should have had permissions added to my older Github account, because that account was deactivated and was tied to my work email address (which I no longer have access to). The record of all my commits from December 2018 to March 31, 2020 are all gone.

There are lessons to be learned there.

### What to do now

I think the best thing that I can do right now is to make something while I get myself together. I have set up my old and busted laptop with Ubuntu 19.10, and I am in the process of getting a dev environment set up.

I had been carrying on with my _Deities & Demigods_ project. It has changed a bit in concept since I first started talking about it. Currently, I am creating JavaScript object of all entries from the 1E DDG book. I have a _rosetta stone_, if you will, of relevant 5E stat blocks, which I will use to perform some data analysis with.

The plan for that is to set up a single page application with React that will display the data, and to pull that data from a Mongo database.

All of our dev environments lived in Docker containers, and although I got decent with troubleshooting Docker issues, I have never created my own Docker definitions, images, and containers. So, I would like for my project to have Docker Compose files and all the fun scripts that build the image into lean homes for individual applications and services. I would like to emulate what I have known over the last 10 months as a developer, as much as I can.

I might not have access to the code from my previous employer, but I can definitely test myself and see what I can build.

### Unemployment

This will be the first time in my life that I have ever experienced something like this, and I have to say that it is truly scary and heart-breaking. I loved the people that I worked with, and I worked really hard to get where I am. It is tragic to think that I will have to struggle. I have applied for unemployment, and have my first meeting with the agency in two weeks. My benefits and insurance are gone, and I will have to look into COBRA, and hope that we can afford it. I have no idea how to access my 401(K) now that I cannot access my previous LastPass passwords (I even changed the email account away from my work email to my personal email, but sadly that was not enough). I cannot see if the benefits that the company promised to contribute were actually paid out. Hopefully, I can get access for that from HR.

No stock options, not much savings (my wife had been struggling with employment and I was covering a lot of the costs trying to make it to the next pay scale), and some pretty high rent. I think we can manage for a few months, as long as stimulus payments are promptly doled out and unemployment benefits kick in without a hitch.

### Good things

I was really touched by the number of people that reached out to me over this. I think that it would be nice to stay in touch with people and to make sure that I maintain my network of people. I am a dyed-in-the-wool introvert and great at self-isolating, but I love people, and I love to talk with things that matter. I am the guy that is more likely to tell you great things about someone else that I know than to tell you about myself. Well, maybe 50/50, but stories about me are not nearly as interesting as stories that others have shared with me.

Anyway, I know a lot of people will have my back, and I will have references from some really cool people. So, I just need to keep going. Wish me luck!
