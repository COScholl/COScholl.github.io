### Fonts, Fonts, Everywhere

I have made my first attempt at syling the site with new fonts. I am
going for a cross between D&D homebrew excitement and all that it entails
with some sort of small press feel. I always wanted to use Jeff Lee's
JSL Ancient in a project, but I don't think it's legible enough for the web.
I did want to capture the feel of an old printing press letter set,
so I went to Google Fonts and got something somewhat akin to that. I am
using the IM Fell group of fonts to flesh out the bulk of the text on this site.

I found it tough to find a font that captured the bold feel of the Modesto
Bold font that WOTC uses for the titles of the fifth edition Dungeons &
Dragons books. In the end, I went with Metal Mania, becuase it seems to fit
the feel of a home campaign and all of the excitement that a DM tries to
generate.

I want to add a font that feel like handwriting, and I have selected one
for descriptive text, but it would be nice to get more of a home-made
feel into this site.

I think I will need to play around a bit more, but I'm at a good starting point.
