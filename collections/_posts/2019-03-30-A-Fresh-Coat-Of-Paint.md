### New Look

After a week, I have started to settle on a color scheme and look.
I came up with the idea of making the site look like someone's notebook
of grid paper for designing tabletop RPG campaigns. The concept was
to bring down some of the slickness that Emi Tanji, Kate Irwin, and
the other graphic design folks at Wizards of the Coast put into
the fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons books.

I made the graph paper background with Inkscape, building up several
layers of translucent blue-white gradients on an orange background,
then adding a grid layer, and finally a filter layer to add a little
more texture. I created a new background for the stat-block with Inkscape
as well, going for a mottled gray and white texture.

The color scheme is a complimentary scheme with an additional dominant
color. I knew I wanted to work with a blue and orange scheme with a
range of grays. And, inspired by one of my favorite shirt and hoodie
combinations, I decided the orange would look good with a darker maroon
or burgundy type red.

The basic five colors I am using for the site are:

 Blue: #004272
 Orange: #FF9800
 Red: #58180D
 White: #EEF6F6
 Gray: #80817F

The presence of that red and the use of the hex color #001E33 (a darker
value of the base blue color) as the color of the main body header pushes
the orange toward a yellow hue in the eye. This is cool, because it means
the site reads vaguely like a primary color palette right now. There will
be some longevity in this palette, and I bet I can achieve some interesting
color effects with it. Not every page will look the same, depending on
the proportion and layout of the colors.

I would like to take the imagery of the site further, and eventually would
like to create some coffee-stain spills and texture. I would also like to
create some white out sections that looked brushed on. Another effect that
might be cool would be water stains that wash out the gridlines on the
background.

There is also some need for working on style mockups for fleshing out the
color scheme and creating novel design elements, but I want to
get new fonts in next. I have earmarked a couple of Google fonts, and I will
be trying those out.

Once the basic look is there, I will clean up my CSS files and write out a
todo list for further style changes. It is important, though, that I don't
spend my weekends solely working on the look of the site, but adding content
to it. I will be working on ReactJS and writing about what I learn here.
I will also try to get in some AD&D __Deities and Demigods__ conversions to
fifth edition.
