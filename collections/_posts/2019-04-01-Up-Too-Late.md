### If You Want to Get to Step X, You Gotta Go Through Step Y

It's way past bedtime.

I had a challenge at work solving a data transformation issue. I'm still learning the intricacies of JavaScript, 
so it took me a while.

I was frustrated that it took so long, and I thought that I would document it after dinner on this site. The issue 
was, in order for me to get that bit of info down, I needed to build out the *Grimoire* page. On top of that, there 
was a styling issue that I had where the relative path on an image in the sidebar kept breaking when I navigated to 
a post in the blog. That had been bugging me.

I fixed the styling issue. It took way too long to figure out such a simple fix. Lesson to myself: look at the output
of the terminal running your application. When something weird happens, you might see it there. Then I went through 
and built out the *Grimoire* page, added collections, and created the *Grimoire* layout to style each entry from the
collection.

After that, I took quite a while to create my first entry in the *Grimoire*. I really took my time on that. I'm tired,
though, so I didn't proofread it. So, I'll push it and follow-up on it tomorrow.

I think I can get four hours of quality sleep now.

*To-do* 
* build out rpg page and collections
* refactor head.html and sidebar.html
* followup with pages in root directory refactor
	* decide if they are all going to be markdown or html and stick to it
	* clean up format based on previous bullet
* get fonts figured out, including backup websafe fonts
* unset styling on links for all pages
* brainstorm future styling additions
