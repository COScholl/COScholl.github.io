### Bombs Away!

Deep breath in. Let it out. One more time. Try to relax a bit...

My first assessment was a bit of a disaster. I thought that an hour would be enough time to tackle these problems thoughtfully. It might have been, had I been relaxed, but I was anything but relaxed.

The platform was Qualified, and I did not like it. I should have played more within the two sample exercises to get me familiar with how it worked. Note to self: if you have an hour to take an exam and you get a playground to work within the test environment with no time pressure beforehand, take another hour or two to mess around and have fun. I could have saved myself tons of stress had I done so. I mean, it's a "take [at] home exam." Just, play.

So, it wasn't really the platform that I didn't like, it was me under pressure in this platform that I did not like. I succumbed to my thoughts around time. As soon as I saw that an output wasn't what I had expected, I started to feel panic. There was this feeling that I was losing valuable time. This really shouldn't have mattered. Had I been properly relaxed, I could have treated this as what it was: a learning experience.

Who knows what is going to show up on a test in advance? No one, if you are taking the exam honestly. I used to love taking exams in school. Well, I guess I loved succeeding at tests more than the act of taking them. This being my first coding assessment, I was already nervous going in. I didn't know what would come at me, and I certainly should have thought more about my approach to problem solving than the problems themselves. Instead, I got caught up on thoughts like, "I'm going to lose time on correcting this," "I should know this," "Oh my GOD, how much time have I wasted on this?" etc. The fact of the matter is, I could have paused, taken some breaths, and worked through things relying on what I already know. Instead of thinking about how I should have used .map() instead of .forEach() for side effects, or how I could have written my string concatenation more gracefully after the fact, I could have just dug into what I was working on, and not cared about whether or not I would get the job. I could have just treated each question as if it were just another freeCodeCamp practice exercise, because all that we do in life is just practice. How we practice is more important that the outcome of this one thing, or that other thing.

Okay, but what about the technical stuff? What did you not do well on? Classes, and some basic React. I really got stressed out about something that really should have been simple. That was around classes. I will add new stuff about classes soon, based on that. I had not really considered class practice examples, and how to work with `this` effectively. A failing of some pretty basic stuff for those who have been working with JavaScript longer than I have. As for React, well, by the time I got to React, I was feeling so wigged out, that I really rushed in without the systematic and relaxed approach that would have allowed me to build things constructively.

So, learning experience. In these times where the job market is tanking, I have to keep calm and only worry about the things that I can control. And, when I can control something, I should work within that space in a calm and relaxed manner. I will add a few things to my daily practice based on this experience, and I will take it with me going forward.
