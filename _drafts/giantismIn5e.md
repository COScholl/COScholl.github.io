I am looking into doing conversions into fifth edition from other games and other editions of D&D.
This kind of practice really helps get a sense for boundaries in creature design, and also, sets
helps exercise the art of creature design outside of the mechanics. The big thing that I will be
working on in the near future is deity stat blocks, and yes, I know that if you slap a stat block
on it, people will want a chance to fight it and see if they can kill it. However, I think this
is a fertile play ground, and there is no real need to get all the mechanical aspects of a deity
just right for an encounter. A deity should be able to wipe out your party no matter what, but, 
when it comes to your campaign, you do you. I'll try my best to get the bounded accuracy right, 
and to come up with a framework for deities that makes sense.

Any way, this post is leading up to that in a way, since I will be trying to systematically go
through *Deities & Demigods: Cyclopedia of Gods and Heroes from Myth and Legend*{:.underlineTitle}, 
starting with the Native American section. In said section, there is *Raven*, the trickster, who 
can fight as a giant raven. That got me to thinking about how giantism works for animals in D&D. 
So, let's see what we can see...

The first thing I want to know is, what makes the creature giant? If we look at *Appendix A: Miscellaneous
Creatures* from the fifth edition *Monster Manual*{:.underlineTitle}, we can get a sense for that.

Since certain elements of a creature's stat block is based on *challenge rating*, and the *Dungeon 
Master's Guide*{:.underlineTitle} suggests picking CR first before creating or modifying a monster,
I think it is safe to assume that not all giant creatures in the *Monster Manual*{:.underlineTitle} 
will have been designed to scale up the same way. That is, a giant ape is not going to be proportional 
to an ape the same way that a giant frog is going to be proportional to a frog. I do think we can get 
a sense for how to convert a creature from one size to a larger size with some general rules.

Also, since certain elements of a creature's stat block is based on its size, like *hit dice*, 
*attack dice* and speed, I think we will find those elements to scale consistently based on size.

So, let's compare some statistical elements for creatures and their giant counterparts.
